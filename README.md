## Introduction
This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It provides unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as the Startup Security Utility in macOS Recovery (“recoveryOS”). It is possible to make your system security much weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This tool is not to be used in production environments. It is possible to render your system unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand how the security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!

I have made this script to put it in JAMF and make your life easy.

Root3 already had a basic in-house support app written in Objective-C and decided to completely rewrite it in Swift using SwiftUI with an all-new design that looks great on macOS Big Sur. We’ve learned that SwiftUI is the perfect way of creating great looking apps for all Apple platforms with minimal effort. In the development process we decided to make it generic so other organizations can take advantage of it and contribute to the Mac admins community.


The easiest and recommended way to configure the app is using a Configuration Profile and your MDM solution.

## Requirements
* macOS 11.0.1 or higher
* Any MDM solution supporting custom Configuration Profiles

## Download

## Features

### Menu Bar Icon
The Menu Bar Icon can be customized to your own PNG with Alpha Channel or using an SF Symbol. Any image will be shown as template to match the rest of the Menu Bar Extras. Icons larger than 22 points will automatically be resized to the recommended 16 points. Optionally a notification badge can overlay the icon to attract the user's attention when an Apple Software Update is available or any other warning was triggered. Please check the preference key "StatusBarIconNotifierEnabled".

### Title and logo
The row above the buttons allow a custom title and company logo. The title supports both text and Emoji. On macOS Monterey and higher, it supports Markdown as well. The logo supports several images types like PNG, JPEG and ICNS and will be resized to a maximum height of 48 points. The original aspect ratio will be retained. A PNG with alpha channel is advised to get variable transparency around your logo.

### Color
All the circles around the symbols have the macOS accent color and will dynamically change with the user's setting in System Preferences --> General. If desired, this color can be customised matching your corporate colors. We recommend keeping the macOS accent color when the color of your choice is too light, as text will be difficult to read.

### Diagnostic information
There are a couple of info items with diagnostics available to choose from. A total of four items will be displayed in the top four buttons. Available items:

* **Computer Name** (default): The current computer name will be displayed here. Especially helpful when your organisation has a difficult naming convention and users want to do things like AirDrop.

* **macOS version** (default): The current version of macOS including major, minor and patch version as well as the marketing name. The marketing name will be easier to understand for your end users. A notification badge will be shown when an Apple Software Update is available. Clicking on this item opens the Software Update preference pane.

* **Last Reboot** (default): The current uptime. When troubleshooting some issue, the first thing you would like to do is a reboot when the uptime is high. The optional preference key ‘UptimeDaysLimit’ can be used to configure the maximum amount of uptime days recommended by the organization. Exceeding this limit results in a badge counter with exclamation mark in the info item.

* **Storage Used** (default): The storage percentage used on the boot drive. When hovering with the mouse, the available storage is shown. Clicking on this item opens the macOS built-in Storage Management app. The optional preference key ‘StorageLimit’ can be used to configure the maximum percentage of used storage recommended by the organization. Exceeding this limit results in a badge counter with exclamation mark in the info item.

* **Network**: The current SSID or Ethernet along with the local IPv4 address. The icon indicates the connection type, Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Clicking on this item opens the Network preference pane in System Preferences.

* **Mac Password**: Shows when the user's password expires and supports both local and Active Directory accounts by default. Alternative supported user sources are Jamf Connect, Kerberos SSO Extension and NoMAD. Shows a warning when the expiry reaches the value set in the optional key 'PasswordExpiryLimit'. The text label in the item can be modified using the preference key ‘PasswordLabel’.

* **Extension A and B**: Support App Extensions to show any information. The title, icon must be configured and optionally a link to open an App, URL, User Command or Privileged Command/Script. The value below the title must be populated by setting a preference key using a script. See [How to populate Support App Extensions](#how-to-populate-support-app-extensions) for more information.

### App, link or command shortcuts
The buttons in the 3rd and 4th row behave as shortcuts to applications or links. Both rows are flexible and can show two or three buttons. The total amount of configurable buttons is possible: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You can configure five variables for every of these buttons:

* **Title**: Button label

* **Subtitle** (now shown if not configured): An extra string to display when the user hovers over the button

* **Type**: The link type the button should open. The following action types are available:
  * App
  * URL
  * Command

* **Link**: Application, URL or command/script to execute:
  * App: Bundle Identifier of the app
  * URL: Link to a webpage or other links that would normaly work like PROTOCOL://URL
  * Command: Zsh command or path to a script. Be aware that this will be executed as the user and therefore has its limitations
  * DistributedNotification: Zsh command or path to a script to run with elevated privileges (requires SupportHelper)

* **Symbol**: The symbol shown in the button, see the SF Symbols section how to use these symbols

The rows with all configurable items enabled are shown in the screenshot below:
* Info items and Support App Extensions in **GREEN**
* Buttons in **RED**

<img src="/Screenshots/configurable_buttons_2.4.png" width="450">

### Footer Text
A footer text can optionally be used to put some additional text at the bottom of the Support App. This supports both text and Emoji. On macOS Monterey and higher, it supports Markdown.

### Notification Icon
The icon shown in alerts and the about window can be modified by using the preference key 'NotificationIcon'.

See an example below:

<img src="/Screenshots/custom_alert.png" width="350">

**Note**: modifying the app icon when it is not running would compromise the App Sandbox and we decided not to implement this. We suggest hiding the app by running the following command: `sudo chflags hidden "/Applications/Support.app"`

### Welcome Screen
An informational window can optionally be shown when the Support App is opened for the first time. It explains the key features to the user before all data is shown. This can be set using the preference key ‘ShowWelcomeScreen’.

See an example below:

<img src="/Screenshots/welcome_screen.png" width="500">

## Configuration
The configuration of the Support app is optimized for use with your MDM solution. The easiest way to configure the app is using a Configuration Profile so you can use whatever MDM solution you like, as long as it supports custom Configuration Profiles.

Some preference keys like the icon and status bar icon point to a file location. Due to the sandboxed characteristic of the app, not all file locations are allowed. We suggest putting the files in a folder within Application Support such as `/Library/Application Support/Your Company/` where the app can read the contents. Other supported file locations can be found in Apple’s documentation about App Sandbox: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AppSandboxInDepth/AppSandboxInDepth.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011183-CH3-SW17

**Preference domain**: `nl.root3.support`

## Advanced configuration

### Support App Extensions

Support App Extensions enable administrators to create custom info items and populate those with output from scripts or commands. You can use your MDM solution to run scripts or commands to populate the Support App Extensions. Optionally we provide SupportHelper to run scripts or commands everytime the Support App popover appears to make sure data is up to date. Please read [Privileged commands or scripts (SupportHelper)](#privileged-commands-or-scripts-supporthelper) down below for more info.

Below are the preference keys to enable Support App Extensions:
| Preference key | Type | Default value | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ExtensionTitleA | String | - | The title shown in the extension. | "Last Check-In" |
| ExtensionSymbolA | String | - | The SF Symbol shown in the extension. | "clock.badge.checkmark.fill" |
| ExtensionTypeA | String | App | Type of link the item should open. Can be anything like screen sharing tools, company stores, file servers or core applications in your organization. | **App**, **URL**, **Command** or **DistributedNotification** (Privileged command/script)|
| ExtensionLinkA | String | - | The Bundle Identifier of the App, URL or command to open. | `defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionLoadingA -bool true; /usr/local/bin/jamf policy; /usr/local/bin/jamf_last_check-in_time.zsh` |
| ExtensionTitleB | String | - | The title shown in the extension. | "Account Privileges" |
| ExtensionSymbolB | String | - | The SF Symbol shown in the extension. | "wallet.pass.fill" |
| ExtensionTypeB | String | App | Type of link the item should open. Can be anything like screen sharing tools, company stores, file servers or core applications in your organization. | **App**, **URL**, **Command** or **DistributedNotification** (Privileged command/script)|
| ExtensionLinkB | String | - | The Bundle Identifier of the App, URL or command to open. | `/usr/local/bin/sap_privileges_change_permissions.zsh` |
| OnAppearAction | String | - | Path to script script or command to be executed when the Support App is opened by clicking on the menu bar item. The SupportHelper is required for this feature. | `/usr/local/bin/runs_when_support_appears.zsh` |

#### How to populate Support App Extensions
Support App Extensions must be populated by setting the value in a preference key within the preference domain `nl.root3.support`. This can be achieved by running custom scripts from your MDM solution or using the `OnAppearAction` combined with SupportHelper. This last option will allow you to update the Support App Extension values every time the Support App popover appears by running the script.

* Create a custom script and populate the desired value by running the following command: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionValueA -string "OUTPUT_VALUE_HERE"`
* Add the following command to show a placeholder while getting the value: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionValueA -string "KeyPlaceholder"`
* Add the following command at the **beginning of the script** to show a spinning indicator while getting the value: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionLoadingA -bool true`
* Add the following command at the **end of the script** to stop the spinning indicator view: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionLoadingA -bool false`

Below a simple example script including loading effect and placeholder while loading
```
#!/bin/zsh

# Start spinning indicator
defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionLoadingA -bool true

# Show placeholder value while loading
defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionValueA -string "KeyPlaceholder"

# Keep loading effect active for 0.5 seconds
sleep 0.5

# Get output value
command_output=$(PUT_COMMAND_TO_GET_OUTPUT_HERE)

# Set output value
defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionValueA -string "${command_output}"

# Stop spinning indicator
defaults write /Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist ExtensionLoadingA -bool false
```

:information_source: When using more than one Support App Extension combined with `OnAppearAction`, it's best to update the values in one script instead of chaining multiple scripts to have the best experience

:information_source: Please do not forget to make the script executable: `sudo chmod +x /PATH/TO/SCRIPT`

### Privileged commands or scripts (SupportHelper)
To allow commands or scripts to be executed with root privileges, the SupportHelper is available optionally. This utility is built on Distributed Notifications to allow inter-app communication between the Support App and the SupportHelper. The Support App notifies SupportHelper and the message contains the preference key set in the Configuration Profile with the command or path to the script. SupportHelper listens for new messages using a LaunchDaemon and executes the command or script by requesting the command or path to the script from the Configuration Profile.

Below an example to force a MDM check-in using SupportHelper and a custom script:

<img src="/Screenshots/generic_version_2.4_beta.gif" width="800">

More information about Distributed Notifications: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/distributednotificationcenter

#### Use Cases
There are a couple of use cases SupportHelper can help with. For example run a command or script with root privileges:
* Every time the Support App popover appears to populate Support App Extensions using `OnAppearAction`
* Extension Attributes (Jamf Pro) by adding the commands to populate the Support App Extension to the EA
* By clicking on a configurable button

#### File locations
The SupportHelper installer places two files:

LaunchDaemon: `/Library/LaunchDaemons/nl.root3.support.helper.plist`

Binary: `/usr/local/bin/SupportHelper`

#### Security considerations
As SupportHelper is able to execute scripts or commands with root privileges, it needs to be used responsibly. For most deployments, SupportHelper will not be needed and we recommend deploying the Support App without SupportHelper. If you're unsure or unfamiliar with this concept, DO NOT use SupportHelper. This utility is separated from the Support App to avoid compromising the app-sandbox as well.

:information_source: Only values from a Configuration Profile will be used. Values set by `defaults write` will be ignored as it imposes a security risk.

### Jamf Pro variables
When using Jamf Pro as the MDM solution, variables from Jamf Pro can be used in the Configuration Profile values to dynamically populate text like the title, footer or any other text field.

Example
* Set `title` to "Hi $FULLNAME!"

More information about Jamf variables: https://docs.jamf.com/10.36.0/jamf-pro/documentation/Computer_Configuration_Profiles.html

## How to use SF Symbols
We choose to go all the way with SF Symbols as these good looking icons are designed by Apple and give the app a native look and feel. All icons have a symbol name which you can use in the Configuration Profile. As these icons are built into macOS, it automatically shows the correct icon.

* Download SF Symbols [**here**](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
* Select the icon you’d like to use
* Copy the symbol name and paste into your Configuration Profile

<img src="/Screenshots/how_to_use_sf_symbols.png" width="800">

## MDM deployment
It is recommended to deploy the Configuration Profile first before installing the Support app.

### Jamf Pro custom JSON schema
A JSON Schema for Jamf Pro is provided for easy configuration of all the preference keys without creating/modifying a custom Configuration Profile in XML format. Download the JSON file [**here**](https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp/blob/master/Jamf%20Pro%20Custom%20Schema/Jamf%20Pro%20Custom%20Schema.json)

More information about the JSON Schema feature in Jamf Pro: https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/json-schema/10.19.0/Overview.html

<img src="/Screenshots/jamf_pro_custom_schema.png" width="800">

### Installer or app bundle
Depending on your preference or MDM solution you can use either the installer or zipped app bundle. The installer includes a LaunchAgent and is the recommended method.

### Sample LaunchAgent
A sample LaunchAgent to always keep the app alive is provided [**here**](https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp/blob/master/LaunchAgent%20Sample/nl.root3.support.plist)

### Sample Configuration Profile
A sample Configuration Profile you can edit to your preferences is provided [**here**](https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp/blob/master/Configuration%20Profile%20Sample/Support%20App%20Configuration%20Sample.mobileconfig)

#### Background Item Management
A sample Configuration Profile is provided (both signed and unsigned) for macOS 13 and higher to avoid users from disabling the LaunchAgent in System Settings > General > Login Items. The profile uses the Root3 Team ID to only allow signed software from Root3.

Logs can be viewed from Console or Terminal by filtering the subsystems `nl.root3.support` (Support App) and `nl.root3.support.helper` (SupportHelper).

An example to stream current logs in Terminal for troubleshooting:
```
log stream --debug --info --predicate 'subsystem contains "nl.root3.support"'
```

## Known issues
* Buttons may keep a hovered state when mouse cursor moves fast: FB8212902 (**resolved in macOS Monterey**)
* When Jamf Connect is used as password type, clicking "Change Now" does not allow the user to open the Jamf Connect change password window, but instead triggers an alert. Jamf Connect does not support a URL Scheme for opening the Change Password window. Please upvote this feature request: https://ideas.jamf.com/ideas/JN-I-16087

## Changelog

**Version 2.4**
* Support App Extensions: introducing a new way to make your own custom info items and provide relevant information to your end users and create actions. Extensions can show anything you want and can be populated using scripts or commands, for example using your MDM solution. There is support for two Extensions to use in the info item rows.
* SupportHelper (separately available): there is now support for privileged scripts and commands to run directly from a button in the Support App while preserving the App Sandbox. An optional utility called SupportHelper will be required and handles the execution on behalf of the Support App. This is built on the Distributed Notifications framework to allow inter-app communication. SupportHelper is a separate installer and is not included in the standard Support App installer.
* Optional info items row: an extra row with info items or Extensions can now be enabled. When enabling this third row, it will show the Password and Network info items by default. The row can show any info item or Extension.
* New password sources: the Password info item can now be configured to show password expiry information from Jamf Connect, Apple’s Kerberos SSO Extension or NoMAD. Set preference key "PasswordType" to "JamfConnect", "KerberosSSO" or "Nomad".
* The title text now supports markdown just like the footer text.
* Items no longer show a hover effect when no link is configured, allowing buttons to be static without a clickable action. This applies to both configurable buttons and Extensions

**Version 2.3**
* Welcome Screen: an informational window can now optionally be shown when the Support App is opened for the first time. It explains the key features to the user.
* Preference key ‘StorageLimit’ added to configure the maximum percentage of used storage recommended by the organization. When the limit is reached, a badge counter with exclamation mark will be shown in the Storage tile. Also a little orange notification badge can overlay the menu bar icon when the preference key ‘StatusBarIconNotifierEnabled’ is set to ‘true’.
* The Network info item now shows either the current SSID or Ethernet as the title instead of ‘IP Address’.
* Preference key ‘NotificationIcon’ added to configure a custom square image to be shown in alerts and the about window.
* The notification badge in the StatusBarItem can now show either orange or red, depending on the current state. An available software update will overrule orange warnings and will show a red notification badge.
* A footer option is added to put some additional text at the bottom of the Support App. This supports both text and Emoji. On macOS Monterey and higher, it supports Markdown.
* French localization is added
* macOS Monterey compatibility
* Bug fixes and improvements

* Mac Password is added as a configurable info item. It shows the days until the Mac password expires. Clicking the item will open Accounts in System Preferences. Local accounts and Active Directory accounts are supported. The text label in the item can be modified using the preference key ‘PasswordLabel’.
* Preference key ‘UptimeDaysLimit’ added to configure the maximum amount of uptime days recommended by the organization. When the limit is reached, a badge counter with exclamation mark will be shown in the Last Reboot tile. Also a little notification badge can overlay the menu bar icon when the preference key ‘StatusBarIconNotifierEnabled’ is set to ‘true’
* Preference key ‘PasswordExpiryLimit’ added to configure the minimum amount of days before the user should change the Mac password. When the limit is reached, a badge counter with exclamation mark will be shown in the Mac Password tile. Also a little notification badge can overlay the menu bar icon when the preference key ‘StatusBarIconNotifierEnabled’ is set to ‘true’.
* Flexible rows of for App, URL or Command: The middle button is now optional, offering a two or three button row. The middle button are enabled by setting the following keys: FirstRowTitleMiddle or SecondRowTitleMiddle. Together with HideFirstRow and HideSecondRow, the total amount of configurable buttons is possible: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. As a result, keys for the middle buttons no longer have default values and the app shows two buttons by default;
